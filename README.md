# Mitigating-Bird-Strikes-in-Aviation-Project-
The project is analyized by exploratory data analysis by creating dashboards using Tableau

Conduct an exploratory data analysis utilizing Tableau's visualization capabilities and dashboards to leverage a comprehensive flight bird strike dataset to identify patterns and key risk factors contributing to bird strikes.
Extract actionable insights from the provided data, focusing on key areas such as safety improvement, regulatory compliance, operational efficiency, cost reduction, and more.
â€¢ Focus on key areas:
Safety Improvement: Analyze strike frequency based on aircraft type, altitude, and bird species to identify high-risk situations.
Regulatory Compliance: Assess reporting accuracy and timeliness based on weather conditions and pilot warnings.
Injury Prevention: Assess the incidents leads to injuries.
Wildlife Conservation: Analyze most affected bird species and develop habitat management strategies.
